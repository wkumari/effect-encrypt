# NOTE WELL.

This repo contains a __copy__ of the [draft-mm-wg-effect-encrypt - Effects of Pervasive Encryption on Operators](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mm-wg-effect-encrypt/) Internet Draft.

This repo is __not__ for working or collaborating on this document - comments on the document itself should go the the authors of the document / the IETF list.
This repo exists _purely_ so that we can look at the current (to be balloted on) version, and is a cunning plan to use GitHubs excellent diff tools to see what the final version with comments addressed would look like.

This repo will be deleted at the end of the process.
